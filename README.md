### Tech Stack and Libraries:
- React and TypeScript
- React Router Dom
- React Query
- axios api instance (branch - feat/api)
- i18next
- TailwindCSS (branch - feat/tailwind)
- i18next
- Vite, Eslint, Husky

### Scripts:

#### `npm run dev`

Starts the dev server.

#### `npm run build`

Build the app.

#### `npm run preview`

Launch the build app in a server for local preview.

#### `npm run lint`

Lint files.

#### `npm run lint-fix`

Fix all auto-fixable ESLint problems.

#### `npm run translate`

This command generates the `./src/i18n/locales/{locale}.json` files.

Don't manually add translations to `./src/i18n/locales/{locale}.json` files!


### Translations

The source of truth for the translations is this file:
`./scripts/translations.csv`

1. Run `npm run translate` and the translations will be generated.

> NOTE 1: if you have conflicts in the code, just rerun `npm run translate`, as the source of truth is always `./scripts/translations.csv`.

**How to remove translations?**

Do not remove them right away.
1. Mark the translation as @deprecated in the translation file. (put the string "@deprecated" somewhere in the translation file).
2. Remove all places in the code where the translation was used.
3. After the code was merged to `develop`, only then would be a good time to delete the translations from the file.

**Why don't delete translations right away?**

The front project has type-safety (the strings inside `t` are type-safe. `t("this_string_is_type_safe")`)
When working with a group of people or different branches, that can cause issues with TypeScript complaining that translations are missing, and the project cannot be compiled successfully.


### TailwindCSS

This project uses TailwindCSS.
Tailwind separate branch `feat/tailwind`, it is necessary merge with develop branch.

All configuration is in `tailwind.config.cjs`.

> NOTE: if you use https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense/ plugin. you can specify the following setting, to improve the DX experience:
```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["classNames\\(([^)]*)\\)", "'([^']*)'"]
  ]
}
```
### vite.config.js

Configures Vite to support TypeScript path aliases, adds support for SVGR to enable use of SVG's as in a Create React App, add's "vite-plugin-checker" that spans a new process to run type checking.

### ESLint

ESLint is used to lint and format the code.

### Husky

Husky is used to:
- verify that all test pass before the code gets committed.
- verify that all code is formatted according to the ESLint rules before the code gets committed.
- validate the format of a commit message:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```
See the list of valid "type" types in `commitlint.config.cjs`.
Example of valid messages:
```
fix(FUN-112): Use Big.js in order to have precise rounding
fix: Use Big.js in order to have precise rounding
```

### Things to Know
- `npm` is the default package manager.
- When exporting Page components, make sure to export as default, because routes are lazy load.
